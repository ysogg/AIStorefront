# AI Storefront

I feel like keyword searching on sites like Amazon is outdated and often returns unhelpful results when the query is anything either than rigid keywords


I see AI as the obvious solution to this problem and honestly wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the norm in the next few years


This is a brief demo on how something like this would work


If you'd like to test this make sure to add a .env file with your gemini key as REACT_APP_API_KEY


## Startup

[FE] - npm start
[API] - fastapi dev main.py (and set up your venv)
